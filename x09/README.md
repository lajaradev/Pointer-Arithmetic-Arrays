<h2 align="center"> Filtered Median Matrix </h2>

<h6> 
C program that reads an image from a binary file
square in raw format in shades of gray.

Perform a filter by mediana, that is, on the filtered image (matrix of
the same dimension as the original) each pixel is replaced by a filtered pixel.

The filtered pixel is obtained from the 9 pixels that make up the square
whose center is the pixel to filter. These 9 pixels are ordered from least to greater and the filtered pixel is the central value, that is, the index 4 (assuming indices from 0 to 8).

Use at least two sort methods.
