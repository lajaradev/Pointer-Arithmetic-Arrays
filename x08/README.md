<h2 align="center"> Filtered Average Matrix </h2>

<h6> 
C program that reads an image from a binary file
square in raw format in shades of gray.

Perform a filter by average, that is, on the filtered image (matrix of
the same dimension as the original) each pixel is replaced by a filtered pixel.
The filtered pixel is the average of the 9 pixels that make up the square whose center is the pixel to be filtered. Those pixels that do not have the full square are not filtered and are copied to the filtered image.
