<h2 align="center"> Average Matrix </h2>

<h6> 
C program that reads a square matrix of unsigned integers from a binary file.

Calculate the mean value (avgValue) of row 1 (rowIndex = 0).

Repeat:
Analyze the next row (rowIndex++), that is, calculate how many elements of this row are greater than the average value stored in avgValue:
If the number returned is greater than half the size of the row, the new value of avgValue is the average value of this row.
